This movie follows the waning career of Evie, a former B-list celebrity fighting for relevency in the cut-throat, ageist film and television industry.
Evie and her friend Coco take on Varla, a budding starlet, as a new roomate. However, demons from Evie's past rear their heads
when she realizes who Varla really is. This is a campy, hilarious comedy that features all drag performers. Each perfomer has a unique comedic style
that will provide laughs for all viewers. If you like Priscilla, Queen of the Desert or Wet Hot American Summer, you will love Girls Will Be Girls.
